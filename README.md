# PowellGoggles

This is a quick project in which I first build, and then spoof, a simple facial-recognition program.

I'll train a machine learning algorithm to correctly identify photographs of several politicians, and then design a special pair of sunglasses which trick the program into misidentifying George W. Bush as Colin Powell.

You can read the notbook either by clicking on the "ipnb" file above, or (perhaps better) on the Jupyter
[Jupyter NBViewer](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/mkmcc/PowellGoggles/blob/master/Powell%20Goggles.ipynb)
site.
